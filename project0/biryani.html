        </ul>
        <h3>Step 1- Prepare the marinade and let the chicken marinate for an hour
        </h3>
        <p>To prepare this Mughlai recipe, take a large bowl mix yoghurt (curd) with red chilli powder, turmeric powder,
            cumin
            powder, coriander powder, along with ginger and garlic paste. Mix all the ingredients well and add chopped

            the mixture and let the chicken marinate for about an hour. When the chicken is marinated, add thinly sliced
            onions and
            salt to it.</p>
        <h3>Step 2- Saute the spices for cooking chicken</h3>
        <p>To cook the chicken, put a copper vessel on low-medium flame and heat ghee in it and add all the whole
            spices.
            Let the
            spices crackle and add the marinated chicken into the vessel. Saute the chicken well. Now, add ginger and
            garlic
            paste
            into the chicken along with the sliced onions, and saute them again for a minute.</p>
        <h3>Step 3- Cook the chicken in curd and spices</h3>
        <p>Then, add the beaten curd and saute the chicken till the oil separates. When the oil is separated, add mace
            and
            cardamom
            powder into it and saute the chicken for a minute. And then add the water and cook the chicken on low-medium
            flame. Put
            the lid on vessel once the chicken is cooked.</p>
        <h3>Step 4- Cook basmati rice</h3>
        <p>Now on another burner, boil water in a pan and add the whole spices along with salt and lemon juice. Once the
            water

            and
            cream
            nicely. Now, make a final layer of the garnishing with mint leaves, saffron and thinly sliced onions and
            pour
            kewra,
            rose water in it.</p>
        <h3>Step 6- Cover the pan with the dough and seal it</h3>
        <p>Make a dough of the whole wheat flour and apply it on the rim of the pot, and then cover with a lid. Seal the
            copper
            vessel and let it cook over medium flame. Once the biryani is cooked, slowly remove the dough and serve it
            hot
            with
            raita.</p>
        <h3>Step 7- Tips for making Chicken Dum Biryani</h3>
        <p>1. For making Chicken Dum Biryani when applying dum, make sure it is air-tight, else the biryani will not
            have a
            great
            taste. 2. You can also put a foil paper over the dough, and then cover the lid. This will help you in
            getting
            the
            perfect dum biryani. 3. Marinate the chicken for 1-2 hours for juicier meat.</p>
